Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator naive/calculator/res_cmp_eq00031
   failed to merge with F5 multiplexer naive/calculator/res_mux0000<5>110_f5. 
   There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal
   timing.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net serial2/wrn is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <clkClick_IBUF> is incomplete. The
   signal does not drive any load pins in the design.

    Number used as Latches:              42
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             9,813 out of  17,344   56%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          7,722 out of   8,672   89%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   7,722 out of   7,722 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   7,722   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      13,878 out of  17,344   80%
    Number used as logic:             9,813
    Number used as a route-thru:      4,065

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 86 out of     250   34%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     5 out of      24   20%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.85

Peak Memory Usage:  508 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  30 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   29 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Mapping completed.
